Character Dialogue Generator

This is a dialogue generator for a character conversation. It uses a character profile and a starting conversation to generate a dialogue between two characters.
How to Use
Run the characterglm_example.py file to generate a dialogue.
The dialogue will be saved to a file named dialogue.txt.
You can modify the create_character_profile function to change the character profiles.
You can modify the messages list to change the starting conversation.
Requirements
Python 3.x
requests library
dotenv library
api library (not included in this repository)
Notes
This code uses a external API to generate the dialogue. You will need to replace the api library with your own implementation.
The dialogue generator uses a simple algorithm to generate the dialogue. The output may not be perfect and may require manual editing.
